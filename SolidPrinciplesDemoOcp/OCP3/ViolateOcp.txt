According to the Open/Closed Principle (OCP), a method's behavior should be closed for modification but open for extension. This means that once a method is implemented, it should not be modified to accommodate new requirements or changes in behavior. Instead, the method should be designed in a way that allows for its behavior to be extended or customized without altering its existing implementation.

In other words, while the internal logic of a method may remain unchanged, the method should be designed to accept new behavior or functionality through inheritance, composition, or other means, without requiring modifications to its source code.

For example, if we have a method that calculates the area of a shape:

public double CalculateArea(Shape shape)
{
    // Calculate area based on the type of shape
    if (shape is Rectangle)
    {
        Rectangle rectangle = (Rectangle)shape;
        return rectangle.Width * rectangle.Height;
    }
    else if (shape is Circle)
    {
        Circle circle = (Circle)shape;
        return Math.PI * Math.Pow(circle.Radius, 2);
    }
    // Handle other shape types...
}

This method can be considered to violate the Open/Closed Principle because it needs to be modified whenever a new shape type is introduced. Instead, we can refactor it to adhere to OCP by using polymorphism:

public abstract class Shape
{
    public abstract double Area();
}

public class Rectangle : Shape
{
    public double Width { get; set; }
    public double Height { get; set; }

    public override double Area()
    {
        return Width * Height;
    }
}

public class Circle : Shape
{
    public double Radius { get; set; }

    public override double Area()
    {
        return Math.PI * Math.Pow(Radius, 2);
    }
}

// Client code
public double CalculateTotalArea(IEnumerable<Shape> shapes)
{
    double totalArea = 0;
    foreach (var shape in shapes)
    {
        totalArea += shape.Area();
    }
    return totalArea;
}


Now, if we introduce a new shape type (e.g., Triangle), we can simply create a new class that inherits from Shape and implements its Area method, without needing to modify the CalculateTotalArea method. This adheres to the Open/Closed Principle, as the behavior of CalculateTotalArea is closed for modification but open for extension.

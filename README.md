#S.O.L.I.D Principles

SOLID principles are a set of five design principles that guide software developers in writing clean and maintainable code.
1.)	Single Responsibility Principle : A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one responsibility or job.
2.)	Open-Closed Prensiple
3.)	Liscov Subsutiation Principle : Base Class should be replaceable to derived Class without affecting the correctness of the program.
